defmodule GenMQTT do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  A behaviour module for implementing MQTT client processes.

  ## Example

  The following example subscribes to a topic and responds by printing
  messages.

      defmodule TemperatureLogger do
        use GenMQTT

        def start_link do
          GenMQTT.start_link(__MODULE__, nil)
        end

        def on_connect(state) do
          :ok = GenMQTT.subscribe(self, "room/+/temp", 0)
          {:ok, state}
        end

        def on_publish(["room", location, "temp"], message, state) do
          IO.puts "It is #{message} degrees in #{location}"
          {:ok, state}
        end
      end

  This will log to the console every time a sensor posts a temperature
  to the `room/<location/temp` topic.

  It assumes there is an MQTT server running on localhost on port 1883.

  ## Callbacks

  GenMQTT defines 12 callbacks, all of them are automatically defined
  when you use GenMQTT in your module, letting you define the callbacks
  you want to customize.

  Six of the callbacks are similar to the ones you know from
  [GenServer](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/GenServer.html).
  They are: `init/1`, `handle_call/3`, `handle_cast/2`, `handle_info/2`,
  `terminate/2`, and `code_change/3`.

  The remaining six are specific to GenMQTT and deal with various
  events in a MQTT life cycle:

    * `on_connect/1` is run when the client connects or reconnects with
      the broker.

    * `on_connect_error/2` is triggered if the connection fails for
      whatever reason.

    * `on_disconnect/1` is run when the client disconnects from the MQTT
      broker.

    * `on_subscribe/2` run when the client subscribes to a topic.

    * `on_unsubscribe/2` run when the client stops subscribing to a
      topic.

    * `on_publish/3` triggered everytime something is published to the
      broker.

  All callbacks are optional. A macro will define a default function for
  undefined callbacks, so you only need to implement `on_publish/3` if
  that is what you need.

  ## Name Registration

  A `GenMQTT` is bound to the same [Name Registration](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/GenServer.html)
  rules as GenServers.
  """

  # gen_server ---------------------------------------------------------
  @doc """
  Invoked when the server is started. `start_link/3` and `start/3` will
  block until it returns. `state` is the second term passed into either
  of the two start functions.

  When this function returns `{:ok, state}` it will enter its loop and
  will start receiving messages from the broker, or send messages to it
  as soon as it has entered the connected state.

  Returning `{:stop, reason}` will cause the start function to return
  `{:error, reason}`, and the process will exit with `reason` without
  entering its loop or calling `terminate/2`.

  Start a linked connection to a MQTT broker

  ## Options

    * `:name` the name given to the process.

    * `:host` the host name or ip address of the MQTT broker.

    * `:port` the port number the MQTT broker is running on given as
      an integer. This will default to `1883`.

    * `:username` the name of the user on the MQTT broker, defaults to
      undefined and is not needed if it connect to a broker that
      allows anonymous connections.

    * `:password` the password for the user on the MQTT broker. This
      can be omitted if the broker accepts anonymous connections.

    * `:client` the client ID. A randomly generated client ID will be
      used if this is option is not supplied. Notice that all
      connected clients should have a unique client id. Should you
      choose to generate your own client ID it should be no longer
      than 23 characters, unless the broker supports longer client
      ids. The requirements for a client id is described in the MQTT
      specifications:

        - http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc385349242

    * `:clean_session` boolean value, defaults to `true`.

    * `:last_will_topic` topic to send message to if the MQTT client
      disappears from the broker.

    * `:last_will_msg` the message that will get sent to
      `last_will_topic` if the client disappears from the broker.

    * `:last_will_qos` the quality of service the last will message
      should get sent with. This should be specified as an integer
      value between 0 and 2. It defaults to `0`.

    * `:reconnect_timeout` the number of seconds the client will wait
      for a connection when attempting to reconnect to a broker.

    * `:keepalive_interval` the number of seconds between keep alives.

    * `:retry_interval` the number of seconds between reconnection
      attempts if the client disconnects from the broker.

    * `:proto_version` which MQTT protocol version to use, defaults to
      version `3`.

    * `:transport` the network transport the client should use to
      communicate with the broker and its respective options.  The
      default transport is `{:gen_tcp, []}`. For basic SSL support use
      `{:ssl, ssl_options}`, which can be configured according to the
      Erlang documentation on the `:ssl` module:
      http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-1/man/ssl.html

    * `info_fun` a function that can be passed in for logging,
      benchmarks, debugging, etc. It should not be used in production.
      Please refer to the unit tests of this project for a simple
      example of usage.
